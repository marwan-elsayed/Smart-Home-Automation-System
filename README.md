# Smart-Home-Automation-System
This project demonstrates a Smart Home Automation System built using the ATmega32 microcontroller. It automates lighting, fan speed, and fire detection based on environmental sensors like an LDR, LM35 temperature sensor, and a flame sensor. The system also provides real-time monitoring through a 16x2 LCD display
